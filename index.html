	<h1>Kevin McCabe</h1>
	<p> Welcome to my personal website.  I am a professor of Economics, Law, and Neuroscience at George Mason University and director of the Center for the Study of Neuroeconomics.</p>
<p>This site documents the use of models and experiments to explore hypotheses that are generated by thinking about the computations that occur in economic systems. The goal of this research is to build explicit theories of economic systems that have more practical use.</p> 
<p>Our <em>main working hypothesis</em> is that economic systems evolve to maximize the computational benefits of economic activity and that this often requires changing the computations made by humans.</p>
<p>The authors page includes the bios and cv's of contributors to this site. The faq page provides our answers to frequently asked questions about computational economics experiments. The blog page maintains a running history of our thoughts on this topic.  The projects page provides links to our GitHub research projects.  The classes page links to our classes being taught. The links page provides a list of links referred to on this site. </p>
