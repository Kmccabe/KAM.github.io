<p>This site explores hypothese that are generated at the intersection of computational economics, experimental economics, and neuroeconomics.  The goal is to build more testable theories of economic systems.  Our main working hypothesis is that economic systems evolve to minimize the computational cost of economic activity and that this often requires moving computations away from humans.</p>
