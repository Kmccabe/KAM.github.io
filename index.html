<h2>What is experimental economics?</h2>
<p>Experimental Economics is a field of economics that designs, builds, and runs controlled experiments to study economic systems.  This research began to get interesting in the last half of the 20'th century as a number of economists began to introduce the scientific method to economics.</p>
