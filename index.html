<p>This site explores hypothese that are generated at the intersection of computational economics, experimental economics, and neuroeconomics.  The goal of this research is to build more testable theories of economic systems.  Our <em>working hypothesis</em> is that economic systems evolve to maximize the computational benefits of economic activity and that this often requires changing the computations made by humans.</p>
