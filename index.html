<h2>What is experimental economics?</h2>
<p>Experimental economics is an area of economics that designs, builds, and runs controlled experiments to study economic systems.  This research started to get interesting in the last half of the 20'th century as a number of economists began to practice the scientific method to facilitate the study of economics.</p>
<h2>What is computational experimental economics?</h2>
<p>As economists built economic systems they became interested in the computations performed by economic institutions.  This interest led to the area of mechanism/instituional design (theory) and the engineering of economics systems (laboratory and field).  The computations performed by these mechanisms were modeled as seperate, but complementary, to the computations performed by the individuals who used these systems.  To close these models it was often assumed that individuals would learn to adopt optimal equilibrating strategies inside these instituions.  Thus the model of individuals was not computational!<\p>
