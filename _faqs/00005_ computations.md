For our purposes a **computation** is a conditionally ordered set of operations that occur inside a computational system.  **Computational systems** consist of a state space together with a platform that can monitor the state space and perform ordered conditional operations on the state space.  The **state space** in a computational system is defined by a set of physical measurements of things in the real world.  Operations in a computational system are assumed to be defined by a physical **platform** which can perform an operation that more, or less, precisely changes the physical measurement of something in the real world.  Platforms can be computers, robots, humans, etc., and any connected network of platforms.  

**Algorithms** are used to model and study the computations performed by computational systems.  Algorithms use an unambiguous language to define the state space, the the effect of operations on the state space.  Using the language specified, an algorithm tells us how to produce a computation that will move the system from an initial state with certain properties to a desired end state with certain properties.  Algorithms are implemented on computational platforms in a language the platform understands using information and operations avialable to the platform.
