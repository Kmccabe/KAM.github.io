An **experiment** is a replicable empirical approach to studying a scientific law of a phyical, biological, or social system.  Scientific laws are explored, by (1)'testing' to see whether or not the consequences of the law are observed in a given system, by (2) 'exploring' the limits of a laws explanatory power, and by 'testbedding' practical uses of a law in realistic systems.  Laws come from abstract models that are built from theories about how a system works.  In exploring a law a model must be implemented in the laboratory, thus any experiment is a joint exploration of the model and its implementation.  Experimentalists tend to develop best practices in how to explore a law for a given system.  The **experimental method** is the current thinking about best practices.  The **scientific method** is designed to move groups of researchers towards a consenus in their theories of the world, the models used to express these theories, and the experimental methods employed.
