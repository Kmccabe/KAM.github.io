Economics is the study of how resources are allocated and used.  Resources are anything that someone might find valuable.  

Economists usually classify the use of resources into production, resources that are used to produce other resources, and consumption, resources that are used to satisfy human wants.  

Resources are allocated thorugh different social activities.  The activity of exchange or trade is central to most economic models.  Two other central concepts are specialization and property rights.  Specialization is the idea that production is more efficiently when people develop idiosynchratic skills in producing certain resources.
