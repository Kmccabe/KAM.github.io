Economics is the study of how resources are allocated and used.  Resources are anything that someone might find valuable to use.  A propoerty right is a right to use a resource in a certain way.  These rights are established and enforced by convention, laws, and politics.   

Economists usually classify the use of resources into production and consumption.  Production occurs when resources are used to produce other resources.  We say specialization occurs when people develop enhamced skills in producing certain resources.  Consumption occurs when resources are used to satisfy human wants.  Sometimes it is useful to think of consumption as a form of specialized production done by the indiviudal or a social group such as the household.     

Resources are allocated thorugh the activity of giving and taking.  One such activity is called exchange.  An exchange occurs when a resource is given to one person and in turn that person gives back another resource.  Exchange is considered a basic, or esential, activity in economics.
