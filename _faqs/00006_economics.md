**Economics** is the study of how resources are allocated and used.  Resources are anything that someone might find valuable to use.  A **propoerty right** is a right to use a resource in a certain way.  These rights are established and enforced by convention, laws, and politics.   

Economists usually classify the use of resources into production and consumption.  **Production** occurs when resources are used to produce other resources.  **Specialization** occurs when people develop enhamced skills in producing certain resources.  **Consumption** occurs when resources are used to satisfy human wants.  Sometimes it is useful to think of consumption as a form of specialized production done by the indiviudal or a social group such as the household.     

Resources are allocated thorugh the activity of giving and taking.  One such mutually beneficial activity is called exchange.  An **exchange** occurs when a resource is given to one person and in turn that person gives back another resource.  Sometimes it is useful to think of exchange as a specialized form of production.  This is true when we think of intermediaries as persons who speiclize in making exchnages happen.

Exchange itself is costly.  These **transaction costs** include finding exchange opportunities, negotiating the terms of an exchange, fullfilling an exchange according to agreed upon terms, and when conditions do not allow fullfillment arbitrating a resolution to the exchange failure.  Minimizing these transaction costs leads to more mutually beneficial exchanghe.

Instituions are often invented to reduce transaction costs.  An **instituion** is a set of rules that are followed by participants in order to facilitate a social activity such as exchange.  Instituions are managed by an organization.  An **organization** is a collection of people who own a set of institutions.  Organization set the rules used by the institutions, determine who is allowed to use the instituions, run the instituions, pay any associated costs, and receive any residual benefits.  The propoerty rights of organizations are often shaped and restricted by rules of law.
