**Economics** is the study of how resources are allocated and used.  Resources are anything that someone might find valuable to use.  A **propoerty right** is a right to use a resource in a certain way.  These rights are established and enforced by convention, laws, and politics.   

Economists usually classify the use of resources into production and consumption.  **Production** occurs when resources are used to produce other resources.  **Specialization** occurs when people develop enhamced skills in producing certain resources.  **Consumption** occurs when resources are used to satisfy human wants.  Sometimes it is useful to think of consumption as a form of specialized production done by the indiviudal or a social group such as the household.     

Resources are allocated thorugh the activity of giving and taking.  One such mutually beneficial activity is called exchange.  An **exchange** occurs when a resource is given to one person and in turn that person gives back another resource.  Sometimes it is useful to think of exchange as a specialized form of production.  This is true when we think of intermediaries as persons who speiclize in making exchnages happen.

Exchange itself is costly.  These **transaction costs** include the cost of finding exchange opportunities, the cost of negotiating terms of an exchange, the cost of fullfilling an exchange according to agreed upon terms, and when conditions do not allow fullfillment, the cost of arbitrating a resolution to the exchange failure.  Minimizing these transaction costs leads to more mutually beneficial exchange.

Instituions are often invented to reduce transaction costs.  An **instituion** is a set of rules that are followed by participants in order to facilitate a social activity such as exchange.  Instituions are managed by an organization.  An **organization** is a collection of people who own a set of institutions.  Organization set the rules used by the institutions, determine who is allowed to use the instituions, run the instituions, determines who enters and who is allowed to exit the organization, pays any associated costs, and receives any residual benefits.  The propoerty rights of organizations are constarined by rules of law. 

One specialized form of organization is called government.  A **government** maintains the exclusive right to tax its citizens to pay its associated costs The government also owns and runs a set of public instituions.  The relationship between government and the rule of law of that constrains how government operates is essential to the health of a country's economy and the welfare of its citizens.
