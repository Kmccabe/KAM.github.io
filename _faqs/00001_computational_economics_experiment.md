A **computational economics experiment** uses the experimental method to study the computational propoerties of an economic system.  An **economic system** consists of an economic enviornment, one or more economic institutions, and one or more decision makers who interact with the instituion(s) to produce changes in the economic enviornment.

Advances in technology allow us to run computational economics experiments by building agent based models, calibrating the parameters of the model with large scale data bases, and then running computer experiments by simulating the model on the computer.  The goal of these simulation experiments is to generate hypothese about laws governing the emergent behavior of the system as a whole.
