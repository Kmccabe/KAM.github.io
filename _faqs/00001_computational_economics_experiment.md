A **computational economics experiment** uses the experimental method to study the computational propoerties of an economic system.  An **economic system** consists of an economic enviornment, one or more economic institutions, and one or more decision makers who interact with the instituion(s) to produce changes in the economic enviornment.

## Current Practice
This is just a brief description of the current types of economics experiments.

## Agent Based Experiments
Advances in technology allow us to run **agent based experiments** by programming the enviornment, instituions, and decision makers, in an economic system, calibrating the parameters of the program with large scale data bases, and then running computer experiments by simulating the effect of paramter changes on the computer.  The goal of these agent based experiments is to generate hypothese about laws governing the emergent behavior of the system as a whole.
