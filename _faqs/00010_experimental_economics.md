Experimental economics is an area of economics that designs, builds, and runs controlled experiments to study economic systems.  This research started to get interesting in the last half of the 20'th century as a number of economists began to practice the scientific method to facilitate the study of economics.

In 1976 Vernon Smith published a paper on the induced value method in experiments.  This paper demonstrated how subjects in an experiment can be given preferences by the experimenter.

The theory of economic systems began to take shape at the same time as a number of economists began to contribute to the New2 institutional economics and what is currently called mechanism design.
