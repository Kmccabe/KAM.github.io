As economists built economic systems they became interested in the computations performed by economic institutions.  This interest led to the area of mechanism (or instituional design) and the engineering of economics systems.  The computations performed by these mechanisms were modeled as seperate, but complementary, to the computations performed by the individuals who used these systems.  To close these models it was often assumed that individuals would learn to adopt optimal equilibrating strategies inside these instituions.  Thus the model of individuals was not computational!
